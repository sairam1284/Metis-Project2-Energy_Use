# Project 2- Understanding Energy Consumption of London Homes

### Objective
Utilize Web Scraping to obtain relevant weather data.  Incorporate Linear Regression modeling to study the relationship between daily energy usage and weather.  

### Key Feature Variables:
* Temperature
* Relative Humidity
* Wind Speed
* Day of Week
* Type of Neighborhood
* Time of Day
* Approximate # of bedrooms
* Approximate # of people

### Target Audience and Key Recommendations:
* Utility company - better predict what their load will be by looking at the upcoming weather
* Government - If they want to reduce home energy usage, identifying the main drivers will allow government to attack low-hanging fruit. (i.e. If winter weather and heating are the main factors of energy usage, perhaps investing in better insulation or more efficient heating systems will give more bang for the buck than installing expensive solar panels)
* Local communities looking for ways to reduce energy load: (i.e. if we see that high temperature increases energy usage, maybe increasing the amount of green cover in areas will reduce energy usage)

### Key conclusions from the analysis:
* To what degree do certain weather factors affect energy consumption
  * Temperature shows a strong negative correlation with daily energy consumption suggesting Winter and Heating are the main drivers of home energy usage in London.
* To what degree do other factors affect energy consumption
  * The # of bedrooms
  * The wealth of neighborhood the home is located in
  * Sunday has significantly higher energy usage
