# Project 2- Predicting Energy Consumption of London

### Objective:
* See how daily weather conditions affect energy demand in the city of London.


### Key Input Variables:
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Relative Humidity
* Dew Point
* Precipitation
* Day of Week
* Holiday
* Time of Day
* Population

### Key Output Variables:
* Electricity Usage
* (If Possible) Natural Gas Usage

### Datasets:
* Web-scraped historical Data from Weather Underground in London for years 2012-2013
* Energy Usage from Smart Meters in London- Kaggle
    * The dataset includes over Million+ rows from many homes in the London Area
    * Try to get a representative sample from Affluent, Comfortable, and Adversity households
* (If Possible) Look at affect of Cloud Cover as well

### Key Insights:
* To what degree do certain weather factors affect energy consumption
* To what degree do other factors affect energy consumption
* Bigger Picture: Looking at the expected change in population and global temperature increases, how will this affect the city's energy demand moving


### Target Audience and Key Recommendations:
* Utility company - better predict what their load will be by looking at the upcoming weather
* Government - If they want to pursue clean energy, how much and what types of clean energy would be most appropriate. (i.e. if it turns out the highest load is at nighttime, maybe putting in tons of solar without adequate battery storage is not the best idea)  
* Local communities looking for ways to reduce energy load: (i.e. if we see that high temperature increases energy usage, maybe increasing the amount of green cover in areas will reduce energy usage)
